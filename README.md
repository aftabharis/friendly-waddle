# body alcohol content detection

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

In every industry they have strictly restricted the use of alcohol. Creating a device that can scan a person and detect the blood-alcohol level and with the application of AI, deciding whether that person is fit or not will be of great use.

## Background

Restriction of alcohol at place of work is common in every industry. for example, in aviation industry it is very strict that a person should not take alcohole 12hr before work. but, i have seen people consuming it during work and loosing their concentration. This situation which i came across really motivated  me to implement something to stop this act. If this come to action, the safety will not be compramized.

## How is it used?
This particular device can be implemented in every aiorport. The idea of working is simple. Workers are asked to pass through the  scanning machine. A monitor inbuilt with the machine reveals the blood-oxygen level and the AI decides if He/She is fit for the particular work. This hereby eliminate fatigue people from work as safety is concerned. This can also promote a healthy relation between the workers and the working environment.
